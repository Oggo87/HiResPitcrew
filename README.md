# High Resolution Pitcrews for Grand Prix 4

A DLL to overcome the original limitation of 400 vertices for pitcrew meshes in Grand Prix 4

## Description

Grand Prix 4 has been extensively modded for years, and hi-resolution material meshes and textures have become the standard. One limitation has remained for years: pitcrew meshes cannot have more than 400 vertices in the original game.
This DLL finally overcomes this limitation, allowing pitcrew high resolution pitcrew meshes to be used.
